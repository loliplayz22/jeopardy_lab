##### TRIVIA (FAMILY-DAY) LAB
is a question-and-answer game built using Python and Flask. The goal of the project is to create an interactive game that challenges users with trivia questions, checks their answers, and keeps track of scores in a fun and easy-to-use format.

## 1. WHAT THE PROGRAM DOES

TRIVIA is a terminal or web-based application that:
- retrieves users and their names
- Loads trivia questions and answers from a structured JSON file
- Displays individual questions to users, one at a time
- Tracks the score of each player based on correct or incorrect responses
- Can serve multiple users (players) and keep track of each playerâ€™s score individually




## 2. All trivia content (questions, answers, categories, and point values) is stored in a separate JSON file. 

# Each question in the JSON file includes:
- A unique ID
- The category 
- The question text
- The correct answer
- A point value
